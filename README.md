This is my first full stack application that I built that essentially gives the user the ability to sign in, sign up for an account and be able to view the 21 savage private fan page.


## Installation

1. Clone repo
2. run `npm install`

## Usage

1. run `node server.js`
2. Navigate to `localhost:8080`
